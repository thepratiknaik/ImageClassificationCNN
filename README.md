🧠 Image Classification with CNNs

Datasets: Fashion-MNIST · CIFAR-10 · Food-101
Framework: TensorFlow / Keras

📌 Overview

This project showcases image classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on three widely-used datasets. It demonstrates how deep learning models can accurately classify clothing, real-world objects, and food items.

🗂️ Datasets

Fashion-MNIST: 70,000 grayscale images of 10 clothing categories
CIFAR-10: 60,000 32x32 RGB images across 10 object classes
Food-101: 101,000 images of 101 food categories
⚙️ Features

Custom CNN architectures and transfer learning (e.g., ResNet, VGG)
Data preprocessing and real-time augmentation
Performance metrics: accuracy, loss, confusion matrix
Grad-CAM visualization for interpretability
Modular, reusable codebase with clean structure
🛠️ Tech Stack

Python
TensorFlow & Keras
NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook
